## Swapping to SOS Full
Swapping to SOS Full to Licentia Black involves a little work, needing a basic understanding of using MO2.

**Swapping to the full version of Schlongs of Skyrim can apparently cause some issues with alignment of animations. By following this guide you acknowledge this issue and are okay with the potential of misaligned animations.**

Ok, onto the instructions.

### Step 1

Start by downloading [Schlongs of Skyrim SE 1.1.4 from LoversLab.](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5355-schlongs-of-skyrim-se/) Don't download the VR version, that definitely won't work.

In MO2, install it in the `Textures` category, below the existing SOS mod. In the FOMOD, select the following options:

1. Default Body
2. Hairless
3. Enable the other addons if you want

In the right pane of MO2, scroll all the way down and you should have 3 plugins below `Occlusion.esp`. 

- Move `Schlongs of Skyrim - Core.esm` to priority **109**, above `DynDOLOD.esm`.
- Move `Schlongs of Skyrim.esp` and any addon ESPs to priority **582** onwards.

*Ensure that `Schlongs of SkyrimSE - Light.esp` is UNCHECKED in the right pane of MO2!*

### Step 2

Next we need to replace the REALORE MEN'S texture with the SOS Full version. Download [**REALORE MEN'S - SOS Full**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67029?tab=files) from the Nexus Mods page.

In MO2, install it in the `Textures` category, below the existing skin texture mod. In the FOMOD, choose the options that suit your preferences. Once installed, ensure it is checked and then uncheck `REALORE MEN'S- SOS Light`.
